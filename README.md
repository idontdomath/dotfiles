# idontdomath dotfiles

This is my approach to personal dotfiles, highly based on [holman dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) with whom I share the topical approach.

As i'm using it's base ideas and scripts for symlinking and loading, so if you if you want to go deeper look, take a look at his repo.

# TODO

At initial setup, moving the way from my bash scripts to manage brew/cash, and starting to setup up zsh on my own (outside oh-my-zsh). Also some initial aliases for some actual needs (that will be growing in the future). 

Next up: REAL zsh customization ad prompt, and git configuration/aliases.
